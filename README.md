## Contents 
  - ### Theoretical Concepts:
    * [Intro to Python for Finance](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Intro-to-Python-for-Finance):
    In this jupyter notebook, I have built visualizations from Stocks dataset.
    I have used Matplotlib package for creating line plots, scatter plots and histograms.
    * [Python Datetime() function for Finance](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Python-Datetime-function-for-Finance):
    In this jupyter notebook, I have explained Python Datetime() function.
    How to create and manipulate Python datetime objects to help identify key financial events.
    * [Exploratory Data Analysis for Financial Data](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-for-Financial-Data):
    In this jupyter notebook, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Stock Prices dataset of a company (any XYZ).
    * [Financial Concepts in Python](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Financial-Concepts-in-Python):
    In this jupyter notebook, I have explained the basic principles of finance. How these are essential in making data-driven financial decisions.
    * [Working with Time Series in pandas](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Time-Series-Data-in-Python/tree/main/Chapter-1):
    
  - ### Case Studies:
    * [S&P 100 Companies](https://github.com/Ravjot03/S-P100_Companies_CaseStudy):
    The S&P 100 is a stock market index made up of one hundred major companies in the United States that span multiple industries.
    In this case study, I have analyzed all the S&P 100 companies as well as sector specific companies.
  - ### Projects:
    * [Predicting Credit Card Approvals](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals):
    In this project, I have built a machine learning model to predict if a credit card application will get approved or not. I have used Credit Card Approval Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
